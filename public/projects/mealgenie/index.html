          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            I designed an AI-powered app called <strong>MealGenie</strong>
            that provides an easy and convenient way to plan and prepare meals
            and discover new recipes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meal planning is a big part of my week but I hadn't found a great
            solution for preparing my recipes.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had recently discovered ChatGPT and wanted to experiment with
            creating an individualized weekly meal plan for myself. I told it my
            likes, dislikes, and other relevent dietary information and asked
            for a personalized meal plan, and I was pleasantly surprised with
            the results.
          </p>
          <p>
            I became interested in designing this app as a way to share this
            experience I had using ChatGPT with others. In particular, I've
            shared it with my mom to encourage better eating habits.

        <h2>User Research & Personas</h2>
        <p>
          My user research included surveys and interviews. I received over 100
          responses in total from a survey that I posted across several
          subreddits.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Respondents were 60 female : 40 male and most were primary cook
          </li>
          <li>
            Over half reported that they had very little time to plan/shop for
            meals
          </li>
          <li>Very few said they were on a tight budget</li>
          <li>
            Wanted more flexibility with recipes (ability to swap/alternate
            ingredients)
          </li>
          <li>
            Wanted wider range of recipes and better recipe search features
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I was able able to narrow down the potential target markets in the
          form of three personas:

          <h3>Betty</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Betty</strong>, the <strong>Busy Parent</strong>, needs a
            quick and painless way to plan meals for the week. She works and is
            the primary cook for this dual-income household. Grocery budgeting
            is not a huge concern. She has kids who also need to be happy with
            the meals.

          <h3>Jango</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Jango</strong>, the <strong>Fitness Guru</strong>, has
            specific dietary needs to achieve his his goals. He's tired of
            eating the same thing all the time, so he's looking for variety. He
            will need a way to swap out items in a recipe to fit his Paleo diet.
            He is an individual who cooks only for himself. He is sometimes
            budget-conscious.

          <p>
            <strong>Maria</strong>, the
            <strong>Parent of a Child with a Food Allergy</strong>, needs
            nutrition information and ingredients listed front and center. Her
            son Alex has an allergy to gluten that she takes very seriously.
            Even she eats gluten-free stuff most of the time because she's
            adapted to it. Dinner is a big part of their family experience
            together with her son. Swapping ingredients is crucial when she goes
            to look at recipes.

        <h2>Insight: Money/budgeting is less of a factor than expected</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Survey results showed only 10% of respondents said they were on a
            tight budget and 30% don't budget at all
          </li>
          <li>
            Nutrition information (counting Macros) was more important than
            budgeting
          </li>
          <li>Some focused on fitness</li>
          <li>
            Decided not to focus on people on a budget (not people who want to
            use items already in their pantry).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </x-column>

      <x-column>
        <h2>Insight: Some people use multiple apps to plan meals</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Some survey respondents entered several apps that they currently use
          </li>
          <li>
            Interview showed people are looking for one app that does it all
          </li>
        </ul>
      </x-column>

      <x-column>
        <h2>Insight: Many people are looking for a better search UX</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Survey respondents reported wanting more recipe variety and more
            customization options when searching
          </li>
          <li>
            Users seemed dissatisfied with their search results and the tools
            they had available to find good recipes
          </li>
        </ul>
      </x-column>

      <x-column>
        <h2>
          Hypothesis: Could AI help people get more personalized meal plans?
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Users are looking for more customization options</li>
          <li>
            Rather of keeping a huge database of possible meal plans, AI could
            probably produce more personalized results.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </x-column>

      <x-column>
        <h2>Design & Usability Testing</h2>
        <p>
          I focused on a simple interface that utilized Tabs with Swipable
          Buttons and also provided a Text Search Box for adding custom items to
          the users' likes, dislikes, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a delay while the results are generated, so I added a fun
          animation to keep the user engaged.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Used maze.co for usability testing, with 20 paid testers</li>
          <li>
            Of those that reached the end, 4/5 stars was the average rating
          </li>
          <li>
            Most testers were excited and delighted that it worked at all: "I
            was pleasantly surprised with the results I was given and how easy
            it seemed to generate a meal plan with the requirements I asked."
          </li>
        </ul>
